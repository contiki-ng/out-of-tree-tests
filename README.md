# Contiki-NG out-of-tree Test Projects

This repository hosts a number of projects forming part of Contiki-NG's CI testing.

The projects in this repo are used to validate whether Contiki-NG can be built successfully from a location outside the main Contiki-NG tree.

You will not really need to clone/mirror this repo unless you are planning to contribute to Contiki-NG's CI test suite.
